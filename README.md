## Introduction
### NFL Sports Betting:
- What is the best information upon which NFL bets should be based?
- It is impossible to predict the outcome of an NFL game with perfect accuracy, but are there patterns that we can identify to help improve our accuracy? The volatile nature of an NFL game makes it difficult to predict its outcome, but with the help of machine learning, we can find the best ways to spend our money in the process of predicting NFL games/scores.

### Approach:
- We tested different classifiers and compared their results to help us find the most important features in relation to winning an NFL game.
- After identifying the most important features to winning an NFL game, we intend to improve upon our investigation by then inspecting which features are most important to predicting the outcomes of different types of lines (ex. which features are most important in predicting that the home team will cover the spread?).
- We want to be able to draw conclusions from the similarities and differences between the different important features that we find between our two investigations, and we know that classifiers will be the best for this. We believe that our best results will come from Linear Discriminant Analysis because of the linear decision boundary. We are hoping to find generalizations across the NFL, and not team by team.
- Finally, we hope (if time allows) to create ML models to predict an NFL win/loss ratio as well as the outcomes of certain betting lines.


### Limitations:
- The main limitations of our results are time and computing power. The datasets that we are using are massive and needed to be trimmed for the purposes of this project.
- Our other limitation is the lack of player data. Teams are comprised of players and a coaching staff. In a perfect world where we have infinite time, we could create models to grade players. It would then be possible to create models that, based on player grades, predict the level of a team. We simply do not have the time or data to accomplish this at the moment.

## Setup
